robsdavis/LE30055_task is the git repository for Rob Davis' answers to the CCAIM RA task.

# Set up
Make sure that the covariates dataset is saved in a folder called "data", under the name "tcga.csv". The dependencies are stored in "requirements.txt" and can be installed with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. 

# Orientation
There are three main code files:
    - data analysis
    - neural net
    - random forest
Each has both a flat python file and a jupyter notebook. I recommend viewing the code in the jupyter notebook, if possible, as it has additional comments and headers in the markdown cells.
